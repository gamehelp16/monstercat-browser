# Monstercat Album Browser

Check out the live demo [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/monstercat-browser/#/)!

Monstercat Album Browser is a site where you can browse thorugh releases by Monstercat in an easy way.

## Improvements

This new version of the site has been updated with a ton of improvements:

- The site has been rewritten from scratch with new and better design!
- Since I'm learning how to webdev the 2K17 way, this site now uses modern web technologies (Vue.js, SCSS).
- The data is now fetched from the Monstercat Connect API which means that it is more up to date and there is no need to add album data manually anymore.
- You can now view released Podcasts and Singles!
- New features like album/track filtering and tracklist sorting.
- Fancy new animations!

If you want, you can still find the old version of the site [here](https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser-old).
